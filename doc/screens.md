### Splash screen

The splash screen is the first screen that appears when the game is launched. It is used to welcome the player and provide them with an overview of the game's features and gameplay mechanics.

There are two buttons on the splash screen:

- **New Game:** This button is used to start a new game. It is the default option and is displayed when the game is launched for the first time.
- **Continue Game:** This button is used to continue a previously saved game. It is displayed when the game is launched after a game has been saved.

Starting a new game will overwrite any existing saved game data, while continuing a game will allow the player to continue where they left off. In a future update, we may add support for multiple saved games, allowing players to switch between different games without losing their progress.

### Nickname screen

The nickname screen is used to set the player's nickname.

### Picture and stats screen

From here, the player can choose their avatar from a set of pre-defined characters. They can also customize their stats, such as the pilot, hacker, engineer, and trader. 

The player has a fixed amount of stat points (currently 20) that they can spend on their stats.

The game currenlty doesn't have gender options as it's intended to be as gender-neutral as possible.

### Ship screen

From here, the player can select their ship from a set of pre-defined ships. At the beginning of the game, the player has a limited number of ships, but as they progress through the game, they will unlock more ships.

Each ship has a set of stats, such as the hull, agility, and cargo capacity.

### Summary screen

This screen is used to review the player's choices and confirm their actions.
