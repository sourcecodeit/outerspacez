# Outer Space Z

**Outer Space Z** is a mobile game built with Nuxt 3, inspired by the classic PalmOS game "SpaceTrader." While our project takes inspiration from this legendary game, *Outer Space Z* offers a unique and modern experience with new features, gameplay mechanics, and a randomly generated universe that ensures no two games are alike.

## Game Overview

In *Outer Space Z*, you step into the shoes of a space traveler in a vast, procedurally generated universe. Your journey begins with the creation of a unique character, where you can choose your avatar, customize your spaceship, and set your initial stats in the following areas:

- **Pilot:** Master the art of space navigation and combat.
- **Hacker:** Break into systems, disable enemies, and gain tactical advantages.
- **Engineer:** Keep your ship in top condition and improvise repairs in the heat of battle.
- **Trader:** Make shrewd deals, buy low, sell high, and amass wealth.

### Gameplay Features

- **Explore the Universe:** Traverse through galaxies, star systems, and planets. Each location offers different opportunities, challenges, and items to discover.
- **Trade and Combat:** Engage in commerce by buying and selling goods on various planets. Choose your battles wisely; while you can attack other ships to steal their cargo, the ever-present danger of space pirates could turn the tables on you.
- **Randomly Generated Universe:** Every game offers a fresh experience with a new universe full of uncharted territories, unpredictable encounters, and hidden secrets.
- **AI-Generated Assets:** Enjoy the stunning visuals and immersive experience created using AI-generated assets, giving the game a unique and futuristic aesthetic.
